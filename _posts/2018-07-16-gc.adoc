title: Garbage collection
---

Plasma now supports garbage collection (GC).
It's a little further ahead in the https://plasmalang.org/roadmap.html[roadmap]
but I started work on it as a self-contained task to experiment with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_mYs0UPt6g&list=PLaaEEl-Qw9by3jR0A-RkCNduEeH12ONJo[live streaming].

Garbage collection will also work along side the new closures and
module loading code.
Modules and their procedures will be garbage collected,
this may sound a little odd but it's a critical step to allowing hot code
loading.
While code has live references to it, it is kept,
but if the references stop existing, or become dead (because they themselves
are no-longer referred to) then that code can safely be freed - no different
to normal garbage collection.
Hot code loading isn't a necessary feature (and you won't find it on the
roadmap) but it would be nice to have and this part of it costs very little.

## The simplest garbage collector

The current goals are focused around getting the language to a state where
it's easy to demonstrate its unique features and moving towards boot strapping.
Having a naive garbage collector allows us to meet these goals sooner, even
if it doesn't perform very well.  Therefore the GC is about the simplest I
could create, it is a mark/sweep, non-moving, conservative collector.  It is
about under 400 lines of code including comments and blank lines.

It also has a number of inefficacies that could be improved with not too
much effort.  For example a single free list is searched during allocation.
Allocation could be sped up dramatically by using multiple free lists for
objects of different sizes which is common in other collectors.

## Where to go from here

This is far from the cutting edge of GC technology.  I do have aspirations
to get to that cutting edge.  However that's not important today, but being
able to reclaim memory is.

We could have used Boehm GC (for example) as a very easy way to add a GC.
However, and without intending any disrespect, projects that use Boehm GC as
an interim solution seldom find the motivation to replace it with a
permanent solution later.  Even though it's be possible to make a collector
tuned to their particular needs, since Boehm GC works fairly well the need
to replace it is never strong enough to overcome the effort required.
Maybe this naive collector will motivate us to work on this in the future.

While it's possible to make some rather good collectors that are
conservative and non-moving
(we're curious about the
https://webkit.org/blog/7122/introducing-riptide-webkits-retreating-wavefront-concurrent-garbage-collector/[riptide collector])
we think this is a limiting factor.
An objects' location within the heap can be used to tell the collector
different things about that object.
A generational collector will often use an object's location to know how
long ago it was allocated (what generation and sometimes what step of that
generation it is in).  For generational collectors, but also some others,
objects will need to be moved eg as they survive each generation.

A moving collector needs to re-write pointers as objects are moved,
therefore it needs accurate information about which values are pointers,
making it an accurate collector (and not a conservative collector).
This can be a difficult thing to retrofit, therefore moving to accurate
collection early is an important priority.
While generational collection often gives large performance gains, it may be
a better test of the GC to implement compacting first.
Before making this change we will probably which to revise the heap layout.

Other fairly simple changes are likely to give a big performance boost.
For example using multiple free lists for different object sizes.

## Conclusion

Plasma programs are less likely to run out of memory, even if the GC isn't
all that fast yet.  Please don't judge it on speed, that wasn't a goal for
this early version.
