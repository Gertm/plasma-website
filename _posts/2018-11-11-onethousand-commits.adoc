# 1,000 commits

I've merged a new 70+ commits onto the master branch tonight and noticed the
that there are now 1,016 commits on master!
Of course this isn't really a mark of progress as much as busyness -
we're (mostly I'm) still here, still working away.

That said we have some exciting plans for the next six months.
Currently link:../../../../roadmap.html[the roadmap] contains three
unfinished items:

 * Basic module system
 * Lambda expressions and closures
 * Multi-module bytecode loading

We plan to implement these over the next six months and move onto some of the
super-exciting things in the next milestone.  At that time it'll be a great
time for to start experimenting with Plasma, particularly if you'd like to
contribute.

Today is also Remembrance Day.  Lest we forget.
